# Excel Analysis
This is work that I did in Excel during my Data Technician Skills Bootcamp.

## Project: Aggregate Values
This project is using the following dataset [retail_sales_dataset_Master.xlsx](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/18945981/retail_sales_dataset_Master.xlsx)

My Data Processing and Analysis Tasks:
- Coverted data in the [retail_sales_dataset.xlsx](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/18946070/retail_sales_dataset.xlsx) sheet into a structured table for better analysis (master sheet above)
- Applied the **FILTER** function to sort the 'Age' column from largest to smallest
- Utilised the **SUM** function to calculate the total commission, displaying the result in cell P10.
- Used the **AVERAGE** function to determine the average commission, displaying the result in cell P11.

## Project: Conditional Formatting
This project is using the following dataset [retail_sales_dataset_Master.xlsx](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/18945981/retail_sales_dataset_Master.xlsx)

My tasks during this project:
- Applied **filters and sorting** to identify and display the top-performing students in each subject.
- Calculated the **average score** for all students and displayed the results in an additional column.
- Used the **MAX** function to determine each student's highest score.
- Identified **the best student in the class** based on average score through sorting.
- Ranked students by highest individual score using sorting techniques.
- Applied **conditional formatting** to highlight the highest and lowest average scores for clear visualisation.
